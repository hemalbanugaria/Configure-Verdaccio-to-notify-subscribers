# Configure Verdaccio to notify subscribers

Verdaccio, a popular open-source private npm registry, does not have built-in support for notifications or subscription features out of the box. However, you can implement notification functionality by integrating external tools or services. Here's a general guide on how you might approach this:

### 1. Choose a Notification Service:

Select a notification service that can be used to send notifications. Some common choices include:

- **Email Services:** Use an email service like SendGrid, SMTP, or others to send email notifications.
  
- **Webhooks:** Set up webhooks to trigger events to external services that can handle notifications.

### 2. Create a Plugin or Hook:

Verdaccio allows you to extend its functionality through plugins and hooks. You can create a custom plugin or hook that integrates with your chosen notification service.

Here is a basic outline:

- **Create a Plugin:**
  - Follow the Verdaccio plugin creation guide.
  - Implement the necessary logic to send notifications in your plugin.

- **Use Hooks:**
  - Verdaccio supports various hooks (e.g., `onPackagePublish`, `onPackageUnpublish`). You can utilize these hooks to trigger your notification logic.

### 3. Configure Verdaccio:

Once your plugin or hook is ready, you'll need to configure Verdaccio to use it.

- **Install and Configure the Plugin:**
  - Install your custom plugin.
  - Update Verdaccio's configuration to use your plugin.
  
- **Set Up Environment Variables:**
  - If your notification service requires API keys or credentials, set them up as environment variables in your Verdaccio environment.

### 4. Testing:

Test your setup to ensure that notifications are triggered appropriately when events like package publishing or unpublishing occur.

### Example (using Webhooks):

Let's say you want to use a webhook to notify subscribers. You can create a plugin that listens to package publish events and sends a notification through a webhook.

1. Create a new plugin:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-verdaccio-plugin
   cd my-verdaccio-plugin
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install --save verdaccio
   ```

3. Create a file named `my-plugin.js`:

   ```javascript
   // my-plugin.js
   module.exports = function (config, stuff) {
     return function (data, cb) {
       if (data && data.action === 'publish') {
         // Send a webhook notification here
         // You can use libraries like 'axios' to make HTTP requests
         // Example: axios.post('https://your-webhook-url', { package: data.package });
       }

       cb(null, data);
     };
   };
   ```

4. Update Verdaccio's config file (`config.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   ...
   middlewares:
     myPlugin:
       enabled: true
   ...
   ```

5. Start Verdaccio:

   ```bash
   verdaccio
   ```

This is a simplified example, and you might need to adapt it based on your specific requirements and the notification service you're using. Always refer to the documentation of the notification service and Verdaccio for more details.
